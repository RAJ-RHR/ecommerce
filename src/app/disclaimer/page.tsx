        <p className="mb-4">
          The dosage of any proprietary Ayurvedic medicine, including Herbolife products, may vary based on
          individual health conditions. For an average healthy adult, a daily dosage of 1500 mg is generally
          considered safe. The recommended serving is 500–1000 mg approximately one hour before each meal.
          Exceeding the recommended dosage may cause side effects, just like any other proprietary health product.
          Always consult a certified physician before use.

          However, adverse effects may arise due to the quality of the product or improper use. For this reason,
